# NFT Generative Art for OpenSea NFTs

The code in this repo was used to create the Gift of Ganesha collection [on OpenSea.](https://opensea.io/collection/gift-of-ganesha) It takes the source images and layers them to create and save a final image, choosing random combinations of items (such as a head, an accessory, and a background) with certain rarities. While the code is customized to this project, the values can be changed for your generative art projects as well.
